## About the project

This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). It allows users to track their workouts by adding, modifying, and deleting their workouts. Each workout includes details such as the exercise name, the number of sets, the number of reps, and if applicable, the amount of weight used for the exercise.
